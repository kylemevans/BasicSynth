# BasicSynth

A Wolfram Mathematica notebook that creates a simple sound synthesizer, useful in teaching the physics behind music and musical instruments. The user can select a tone frequency and the amplitudes of each harmonic of that tone. The user can also add other parameters to the sound such as vibrato, tremolo, and phase differences for each harmonic.

synth.nb is the compiled Mathematica notebook that can be executed directly (much less pretty to look at the source code), while synth.wl contains the raw Wolfram code used to generate the notebook file. If you want to modify this code, you'll want to open synth.wl with Wolfram Mathematica.
